# Hangman Game
## Summary
This project is a Python implementation of the classic word-guessing game Hangman. The game selects a random word for the player to guess, and the user interacts by entering letters to reveal the hidden word. To add a fun twist, I created a custom library of smiley faces that are used to visually represent the results of the game â€” from cheerful face after the 1st mistake to a sad face for a loss.

## Languages and Libraries Used
Python: The primary programming language used for the game.
Random library: Used to randomly select a word from a predefined list for the game.
Custom Smiley Library: A self-created library containing smiley face graphics to display the game results.

## Key Learnings
Reflect on the main skills you practiced and insights gained from completing the project. Do not
limit them to technical skills, remember as a Data Scientist a core part of your job is
communicating technical insights to non-technical audiences.

## Additional Reflections
This project not only honed my Python programming skills but also encouraged creativity in game design. Adding the custom smiley face library elevated the user experience, making the game more enjoyable and memorable. It also reinforced the importance of thinking beyond functionality by considering how to make a program visually engaging for users. Overall, this project was a great blend of technical learning and creative expression!
